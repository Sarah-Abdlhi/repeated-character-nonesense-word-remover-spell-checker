"Google Lens is an image recognition technology developed by Google, designed to bring up relevant information related to objects it jkhhnb identifies using visual analysis based on a neural network.[2] mmnbm First announced during Google I/O 2017,[3] it was first provided as a standalone app, later being integrated into Google Camera but was reportedly removed in October 2022.[4] It has also been integrated with the Google Photos and Google Assistant app and with Bard as of 2023.[5][6] "
"When directing the phone's camera at an object, Google Lens will attempt to identify the object by reading barcodes, QR codes, labelsssss and text, and show releeeevant search results, web pages, and information.[7] For example, when pointing the device's camera at a Wi-Fi label containing the network name and password, it will automatically connect to the scanned Wi-Fi network. Idk...Lens can also use images to identify text and can find results from Google Search or translate the text with Google Translate in augmented reality.[8] Lens is also integrated with the Google Photos and Google Assistant apps.[5] WoooooW"
"The service originaaaaallllly launched as Google Goggles, a previous app that functioned similarly but with less capability.[9][10] Lens uses more advanced deep learning routines in order to empower detection capabilities, similar to other apps like Bixby Vision (for Samsung devices released after 2016) and Image Analysis Toooooolset also known as IAT (available on Google Play); During Google I/O 2019, Google announced four new features. The software will be able to recognize and recommend items on a menu. It will have the ability to also calculate tips and split bills, show how to prepare dishes from a recipe and can use text-to-speech.[11] "
